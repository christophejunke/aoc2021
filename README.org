* Install

Install [[https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/][Quicklisp]].

This code was tested with the =2021-10-21= release of Quicklisp.

** From Lisp

- Clone the repository in =~/quicklisp/local-projects/=.
- Link the =coalton= directory to =local-projects= too, or push its absolute path to =asdf:*central-registry*=.
- Call =(ql:quickload :aoc)=.

** From shell

Calling =make= loads all dependencies and outputs a =quicksbcl= executable, then runs all tests that have not yet passed.
